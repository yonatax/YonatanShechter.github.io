# Hi, I'm Yonatan ðŸ‘‹

**C++ Engineer** Â· **B.Sc. in Mathematics**  
Systems, performance, and correctness. I like tight code, measurable wins, and clear proofs.

## What I work on
- High-performance C++: low-latency systems, memory layouts, lock-free patterns
- Math-driven problem solving: algorithms, optimization, probability
- Tooling and quality: benchmarks, sanitizers, fuzzing, CI that catches real issues
